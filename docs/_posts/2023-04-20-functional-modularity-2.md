excerpt: "Welcome to Modularity in Functional Programming! In this series, I will be addressing how using aspects of the functional paradigm can lead to program components that are easier to reuse and expand upon."

In the first post of this series, we covered what modularity means and how functional programming is uniquely qualified to provide you modularity when writing programs. We covered examples from the "Gluing Functions Together" portion of John Hughes's 1984 memo titled "Why Functional Programming Matters." We will make this second post a short one. It will cover one more example from that section of the memo with accompanying Scala 3 sample code before we move on to the second idea Hughes presented in his memo, "Gluing Programs Together" with lazy evaluation.

If you missed the first post in this series, you can find it [here](/2023/03/functional-modularity-1/)), I recommend going back and reading that post as it sets the foundation for the following example.

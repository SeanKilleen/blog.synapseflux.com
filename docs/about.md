Welcome to Synapse Flux Blog space. I'm Taylor. I like breadth, depth, and detail to a fault. So for this blog, I naturally picked the three broad, deep and detailed themes of computation, creativity, and expression. These themes resonate with me because:

- I believe they are woven into our most exciting endeavors,
- Out of all the things we do as humans, I'm drawn into these three again and again to examine by themselves or in combination with each other,
- Advances in computation between the mid 20th century and when I'm starting this blog in 2023 have made my whole life an exciting time to see how this relatively new technology changes the way we as people do creative things and express ourselves

This blog isn't geared towards creating a theory of these three things. It's more like the intersection of these topics form an expansive picture so big I'll never see the edges of it and I'll be zooming in and making vignettes of portions of this picture with each post. In one post I might share an interesting programming technique, while in another I might highlight computers being used to amplify some creative effort, while still others may be about a general topic like a survey of how people have used software for creative expression in video games. My goal is that once I  have enough content, if you find computation, creativity, and expression interesting, there will be something here for you.

Onward!

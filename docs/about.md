Welcome to Synapse Flux Blog space. I'm Taylor. Virtual handshake if you shake hands. If you don't, then greetings and welcome to my site.

If you stick around and get to know me through my content, you'll probably pick up that what excites me is exploring big ideas one little detail at a time. That is what you will get here with the theme I've selected, blending computation with creativity and expression. I landed on Computation, Creativity, and Expression because:

- I believe they are woven into humanity's most exciting contemporary endeavors,
- Out of all the things we do as humans, I'm drawn into these three again and again to examine by themselves or in combination with each other,
- Advances in computation between the mid 20th century and when this blog is kicking off in 2023 have profoundly impacted my life and made it an exciting time to see how invention of the modern computer, relatively new in our history, has changed the way we as people do creative things and express ourselves

This blog isn't geared towards creating a theory for the best version of any one of these topics or the three of them combined. It is more to stand in awe of them, celebrate them, and share awareness and understanding of how they coexist. The intersection of these topics form an expansive picture so big I'll never see the edges of it. Instead, I'll be zooming in and making vignettes of portions of this picture over time like an aimless space probe. In one post I might share an interesting programming technique, while in another I might highlight computers being used to amplify some creative effort, while still others may be about a general topic like a survey of how people have used software for creative expression in video games. My goal is that once I  have enough content, if you find computation, creativity, and expression interesting, there will be something here for you.

Onward!

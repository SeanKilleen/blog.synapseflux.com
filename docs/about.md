Welcome to Synapse Flux Blog space. I'm Taylor. I like breadth, depth, and detail to a fault. So for this blog, I naturally picked the three broad, deep and detailed themes of computation, creativity, and expression. These themes resonate with me because:

- I believe they are woven into our most exciting endeavors,
- Out of all the things we do as humans, I'm drawn into these three again and again to examining these three by themselves or in combination with each other,
- Advances in computation between the mid 20th century and when I'm starting this blog in 2023 have made my whole life an exciting time to see how it interacts with and changes the way we as people do creative things and express ourselves

This blog isn't geared towards creating a theory of these three things. It will be more like the intersection of these topics form an expansive picture that is so big I'll never see the edges of it, and I'll be zooming in and making vignettes of portions of this picture with the posts. Some will be sharing my personal experiences in computing and creative expression, while others will be exploring what others have thought and done in these spaces. My goal is that once I  have enough content, if you find computation, creativity, and expression interesting, there will be something here for you.

Onward!

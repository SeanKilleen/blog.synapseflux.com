Welcome to Synapse Flux Blog space. I'm Taylor. I like breadth, depth, and detail to a fault. So for this blog, I naturally picked the three broad, deep and detailed themes of computation, creativity, and expression. These themes resonate with me because:

- I believe they are woven into our most exciting endeavors,
- Out of all the things we do as humans, I come back again and again to examining these three by themselves or in combination with each other,
- I believe we are in an era dating back to the mid-20th century and continuing through this blog's inception (2023) where we get to bear witness to remarkable developments involving a mix of computation, creativity, and expression that are only getting more pronounced at an accelerated rate.

To see what I mean, just look at this non-exhaustive list of milestones in computing in rough chronological order to get a sense of it:

- General purpose computing
- the internet
- personal computing
- consistent advances in hardware and software enabling everyone can do more at lower cost
- new devices and software that present progressively less friction and mismatch with our organic ways of thinking and acting
- software and hardware advances (AI, quantum computing, ...) that have gone from futuristic interests to practical realities and that present rich opportunity spaces where we are just now scratching the surface

Due to these and other advances, our creative tools have changed. Our ways of expressing ourselves and communicating that expression to others have changed. What many of us do with our lives and have the ability to do with our lives has changed. I think this is fascinating.

However, I'm the type of person that often can't help but meander around and explore all the little pieces, so up front I'll warn you that the posts in this blog will relate to these concepts, but they will err towards a collection of vignettes rather than an linear series of ideas building to some overall thesis.  We'll talk about the tools technology provides and sometimes how to use them in technical posts, we'll talk about creative endeavors and creativity enabled by computation. we'll talk about creativity and expression in one post, but maybe as it relates to one specific application in computing. Every once in a while I may check in and tie it all back in to this common purpose, but this falls below exploration in priority. So be warned, we'll stay on the path, but I'll be experimenting and meandering all the while as I learn how to both share my thoughts and hold your interest!

Onward!
